# Changelog

TODO:
- Hybrid Step-Generation Preprocessing
- N-Step-Lookahead Generational Algorithm?
Maybe even alpha-beta pruning (using heuristic)?
- In-place Procedural Removal
- Visualization (trees!)
- Crafting Tree Location File Generation?
- OptimizerRecipeList and RecipeHandler common interface
- Queueing system for requests (instead of just locking)

`mane-parallel` TODO:
- Make a common interface for all the recipe handlers


- IMPORTANT: See if disk I/O or compute is the bottleneck, and fix them
to get very, very close to 50rps
- IDEA: Cache results that might be immediately used in the next step
  (next step is by default local query which can be slow if there's a lot of them)
- Add a threaded option (d1 then branch off), 
to see if sacrificing a bit of "order" is worth it for 
computational power
- Add saving and crash-handling logic to main_new
- Revisit some of the old low-step data so I can verify
up to 8-step or 9-step, because more have been found since
revivals.
- Make and test `recipes_ram.py`
- Parallelize sqlite requests

`mane-parallel` Shelved Ideas:
- Lazy generation of recipes (not useful, unless the starting element set)
is very large, which almost never happens.


## Version 1.6.0a5
- Added a `recipes_base.py` and the `RecipeBase` abc
- Added a `recipes_ram.py` that uses a dictionary to store recipes...
Well, not added, more like brought back from the dead.
- Conveted `recipe.py` to `recipe_sqlite.py` and `recipe_requests.py`
- Cleaned up recipe logic - instead of a monolithic recipe handler,
use multiple layers of recipe handlers to handle different request types.
- Recipe order goes `recipe_ram.py` -> `recipe_requests.py`
- Note that the sqlite layer can go between ram and requests, but it's 
not necessary. If I decide to drop recipes from ram (or not use ram)
at any point, sqlite should be added back in.

Important notes:
1) `combine_batch` does **NOT** guarantee the original order 
in requests, because it only re-requests the ones that are not returned by
the current handler.
2) All recipe requests now also return emojis and FD status, to streamline
the process - after all the sql database need to keep track of it, while
it's the requests that contain the info.


## Version 1.6.0a4-multitargettest
- Multi-target iddfs testing
- 2694 vs 2682 for 7-step
- 

## Version 1.6.0a3
- Fixed an ordering issue where `A+B` and `B+A` would be considered different.
This improves performance quite a bit.


## Version 1.6.0a2
- Added a counter to recipe handler to count request saturation.
- `main_new.py` is able to request at 47rps (on a 50rps limit) for up to 6-step.
- Tested lazy generation

## Version 1.6.0a1

- Added `main_new.py` that uses some weird green loop magic to
batch letters to be sent to Princess Celestia (I swear,
web programming is magic!). Tested to 6-step...
- "Patched" `main.py` to also use batch requests. 


## Version 1.5.3

- Simple results database `optimals.py` for the main results
- Added some placeholder files for more optimizer algos trading time
for result optimality, which I hope to implement soon.
- Added a simple optimizer benchmarker
- TODO: Optimize the A* algorithm to shave off around an order of magnitude
of constant factor. (Previously 117.887s for 41 Alphabet g0.5 d3)

## Version 1.5.2

- Added `SpeedrunRecipe` to store speedrun recipes.
- Speedruns now follow the following format:
```prolog
Water  +  Earth  =  Plant  // Comments require two spaces before them
Earth  +  Plant  =  Tree  // Note that there are doube spaces around + and =
// Or they can be at the start of a line
/*
And multiline comments go like this
*/
Water  +  Tree  /* Or even like this, but there must be two spaces! */  =  River
Earth  +  Tree  =  Forest  // :: double colon indicates that this is a result element
```
- Some token analysis in `convert.py`
- `persistent.json` results split into a `Results/` directory

## Version 1.5.1

- Added command line arguments for `optimize.py`.
- Added command line arguments for `speedrun.py`.
- Added command line arguments for `main.py`.

## Version 1.5

Added optimizers for speedrunning paths and finding optimal paths in savefiles!
- Added an A* algorithm `optimizers/a_star.py` starting from the result 
element with a generation-based admissible heuristic. (Source: BRH0208)
- Added a simple generational algorithm `optimizers/simple_generational.py` 
starting from the result element with a generation-based heuristic, 
made for fast analysis of savefiles. Used on yui's site (Infinite Craft Browser).

Other changes
- Separated the `pair_to_int` and `int_to_pair` functions 
along with static variables such as `DEFAULT_STARTING_ITEMS` 
and `WORD_COMBINE_CHAR_LIMIT`into `util.py`.
- Added a `OptimizerRecipeList` class for a common interface
between all the optimizers.

## Version 1.4

Implemented SQLite because the db size is growing and memory is no longer sufficient.
This gives a ~10x performance hit. However, memory footprint of the database itself
is reduced massively. If memory ever becomes an issue again, the visited set and
the optimal recipes (and alternatives) will also need to be shoved into a database.
(Likely no need until depth like, 14-15?)

Also implemented resuming, which saves important runtime data to `persistent.json`
and will automatically load this json to resume from the last point.

There is also now a weird bug where the program will not terminate from Ctrl+C, which
makes all of the `atexit.register()` stuff quite useless. Need to find out why
this is happening, but for now, implemented a temporary save for the persistent file.
(Database is automagically saved due to sqlite3.)

## Version 1.3.2

Added some compression by using ids for items.

## Version 1.3.1

Added a double check for Nothing results, some other "Nothing" options,
and also the code that produces all the minimal recipes for each item.

Note that the verification requests can't be asynchronous because the algorithm
depends on the search ordering, and loosening the ordering restriction means
(intuitively) significantly* more compute for my old laptop it's hosted on.

Also, note that depth 8 actually has at least 6568 recipes, and depth 9 has
at least 17065. I have been using incorrect cached data for benchmarks
because network requests are unreliable.

## Version 1.3

This will try and implement a better version of unused result tracking. (Idea 3)
If there are too many unused results, then the branch is pruned.
If there's a little less, then the branch goes into desperation
and starts using only unused element pairs. This should be correct, and
up to depth 9 it gets the same amount of recipes as before.

Do note that the parity of depth has some impact on the number of states.

## Version 1.2.2


A lot of code cleanup, especially in the `recipe.py` file.
Also added item emoji saving.
(Last update was a delimiter change. In the future maybe I'll make it
2 dict layers for completely unicode safety. No one has made \t yet probably.)


## Version 1.2.1

Added a check for new discoveries. There's probably so many, and they're just
wasted by the program otherwise.

:(

## Version 1.2
Core idea: It's possible to use a naive iddfs to achieve 
polynomial memory complexity at the sacrifice of O((n!)^2)time complexity. 
However, if we can check for repetition in an effective way, 
we can achieve ~=(10^n) time complexity as well. If I didn't do a dumb,
here are the theoretical complexity:
```
Memory requirement:  O(d^3                 (1 additional set for each level, n(n+1)/2 items at most in set)
                    +recipeBookSize(d)     (recipes, which dominates here)
                    +numWords(d)           (storing optimal words, or *d for shortest paths)
Time requirement:    O(d!^2)               (Worst case)
                   ~= (9^d)                (Experimental, due to collisions)
```
Empirically, here are the results up to depth 8, only storing words
of a certain depth and not the recipe in memory.

    DEPTH   |   SIZE   |   TIME   |   MEMORY
     2            29       <0.001     0.01MiB
     3            81       <0.001     0.02MiB
     4           211        0.005     0.03MiB
     5           486        0.036     0.06MiB
     6          1114        0.278     0.06MiB
     7          2682        2.077     0.18MiB
     8          6566       17.031     0.65MiB

### ~~Idea 0~~
~~number all of the words based on discovery order, and then DFS only accepts paths
with an increasing word sequence. This would reduce memory requirement... uhh...~~

This is WRONG, since it's possible such that
```
A+B --> E
B+E --> R (R has depth 2)
```

```
B+C --> H
C+D --> I (I has depth 2)
H+I --> J (J has depth 3)
J+B --> R 
```
(R < J since its depth is lower, but this is valid since ABCDER and ABCDHIJR are different).


### Idea 1
To account for situations such as: (We start with ABCD)
A+B --> E
C+D --> F
vs
C+D --> F
A+B --> E
We can check for ordering, just for the order of crafted items.
This would mean `{a_i} < {a_j}` for all `i < j`,
where if you use `u <= v` to craft, then `a_i = u + v * (v+1) / 2`

Example:
```
Recipe: [-1, -1, -1, -1, 6, 1, 20]
6: 2 + 2 = Wind + Wind = Tornado
1: 0 + 0 = Water + Water = Lake
20: 4 + 5 = Lake + Tornado = Tsunami
```
would be ignored, since 6 < 1. We can always sort the list and come up with the same result.
(Proof omitted)

This is also experimentally correct up to depth 8, 
where the number of recipes is 6566, identical to previously.

Note that for this benchmark, recipes are saved to memory by mistake. 
However, I would not like to re-run since, with tracemalloc, the time
taken was almost 1/2 an hour.
Also, note that the entire recipe file is ~6.5MiB.

    DEPTH   |   SIZE   |   TIME   |   MEMORY
     2            29        0.001    (6.61MiB)
     3            81        0.002    (6.63MiB)
     4           211        0.016    (6.69MiB)
     5           486        0.197    (6.81MiB)
     6          1114        2.515    (7.08MiB)
     7          2682       34.360    (7.79MiB)
     8          6566      490.420    (9.68MiB)


### Idea 2
Check, for every resulting word, if it's possible to reach the same word 
using other combinations at the current step.
This could be done using a set() and then checking if the target word is in the set.

    DEPTH   |   SIZE   |   TIME   |   MEMORY
     2            29       <0.001     6.63MiB
     3            81        0.002     6.61MiB
     4           211        0.010     6.61MiB
     5           486        0.069     6.62MiB
     6          1114        0.532     6.63MiB
     7          2682        4.066     6.63MiB
     8          6566       33.269     6.63MiB

As we can see, memory usage increased a tiny bit (due to the set), but time usage decreased by a lot.

### Idea 3
All new words of a given depth must use all previously crafted elements in its recipe.
Otherwise, we can just remove the unused element, so the word must be at
a lower depth.

However, since I am too lazy to figure out a good way to implement this rn,
we can reduce the condition to that the last item must use the 2nd last item. 
(Memory usage should not change)

    DEPTH   |   SIZE   |   TIME   |   MEMORY
     2            29       <0.001     6.61MiB
     3            81       <0.001     6.61MiB
     4           211        0.005     6.61MiB
     5           486        0.035     6.62MiB
     6          1114        0.279     6.63MiB
     7          2682        2.063     6.63MiB
     8          6566       17.068     6.63MiB

Also, this is not a completed version of the code, since I still read in
old recipes to check if the newly generated ones are the same depth. By
removing this check, memory usage may decrease a fair bit.

Realistically, remember that all the crafting recipes are stored in memory as well.
This is just optimizing for the algorithm itself, and it's been quite successful.
Although time complexity is still O(9^n) ish, the constant is quite low.
Also, this is multithread-able, although I may optimize for # of requests next update.

## Version 1.1
After all the changes made before dfs, here's the benchmarks:

    DEPTH   |   SIZE   |   TIME   |   MEMORY
     2            29        0.002       53KiB
     3            81        0.013      261KiB
     4           211        0.078     1.51MiB
     5           486        0.721     10.7MiB
     6          1114        5.607     70.5MiB
     7          2682       51.326      477MiB
     8          6566      474.911     3.76GiB

## Version 1
Original code by analog_hors + cache to file vs New Code v1
100 recipes:

Memory Usage:               2.09 --> 0.48 MiB

Time:                       0.02 --> 0.012 seconds

486 recipes: (distance 5)

Memory Usage:                531 --> 9.9 MiB

Time:                       1.89 --> 0.27 seconds

1000 recipes: (~distance 6)

Memory Usage:             8623.3 --> 52.5 MiB

Time:                        103 --> 1.75 seconds

Note: Estimated memory and time usage is both ~O(k^n), where k is a constant. k<=10?
